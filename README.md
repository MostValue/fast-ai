# About

This started as a collection of my work on the excellent fast.ai course, but spawned into a compendium of my work on ML/AI which span over 2 years
In it, you'll find some projects I've worked on /am working on, that I haven't found the time to publish, and LOTS of notebooks on notes that I've taken.

Feel free to use this to aid your learning!
